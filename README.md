# GTD - Golden Twin Daggers: The Market’s Villain

**GTD** is a precision-based, emotionally intelligent trading platform built to empower underdog traders. Blending AI, RSI, MACD, VWAP, volume, and storytelling into one sleek interface.

## Key Features
- Real-time trap setup detection
- Character-driven alerts (like “Villain Move Activated”)
- Emotional trading pattern tagging
- TradingView chart integration
- Audio-visual feedback (karate kicks + blade strikes!)
- Backtest engine + setup Playbook

## Dev Stack
- Frontend: ReactJS + TradingView Chart Library
- Backend: Python, Flask, Plotly, pandas_ta, Twilio for alerts
- Tools: Docker, Pytest, GitHub CI/CD
- Strategy Tags: R3Vrs3 This, Dual Challenge Accepted, Slap-Then-Smooth Talk

## Meet The Golden One
An undercover artist by day, GTD’s alter ego lives a double life working at a place called **Anonymous Express**, a high-security data center that unknowingly delivers... **TIME**. Packaged data from market makers? Delayed info meant to trap? Or advanced trade setups delivered to the chosen few?

> “They think I’m just quiet. But I speak in signals. The charts? That’s my language.”

## Coming Soon
- Mobile app (React Native)
- More pattern integrations
- Community portal with Lounge access
- Market stories & GTD lore
